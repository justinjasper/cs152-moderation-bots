1,"A: Hey, great to meet you! I saw we went to the same university. I am super interested in your current job at McKinsey and I was hoping to connect. B: Hey, sure. Happy to help a fellow alumni. Let me know what questions you may have. A: So I know that the company you work at currently has openings for several entry level business analyst positions. I was wondering whether you could help flag my application? Do you have any tips for applying? B: Yes, of course! Feel free to send me a link to your CV/cover letter so I can take a look. A: That would be fantastic! Yes, here you go: https://docs.google.com/document/d/15T4BzFzL978wAPEPV2-RPyk1htRlSzn24kTZJkKLAPo/edit?usp=sharing B: Sure thing!"
1,"A: Hello Sophia, I don’t know if you remember me but we briefly met at the progressive staffers happy hour last week! I work for Cory Booker’s office. As I am currently exploring options to take on Chief of Staff roles I would be grateful to continue our conversation and perhaps get some advice. B: Hi Ann, yes of course I remember! I’m so glad you reached out. Happy to chat anytime. How does happy hour next Wednesday at the Hive sound? A: I would love to but I’m on a Staff Del until Wednesday inclusive. How about Thursday? B: Sure, that sounds great! Where are you guys going? A: We are part of that trip HFAC is doing to Japan. It's a bit spontaneous but a spot freed up so I volunteered. B: Sounds wonderful! Well, looking forward to chatting with you next week."

A: Good to hear, can’t wait to get to know you better!"
2,"A: Hey Ben, how have you been? Was meaning to catch up with you since ages. B: Hey Josh, great to hear from you! Funny coincidence, I will actually be back in New York next week, how about we grab drinks sometime on Friday? A: I am actually attending this talk by a finance professor from Columbia that day. Would you like to join and we can head down to the village after? B: Sure, I’d love to! What is the talk about? A: Recent developments in the FinTech industry. This may seem a bit boring but apparently there will be a guest speaker from SeedInvest. B: Nice! Yes, I’m down. A: Great, please meet me at 5 PM at Columbia School of Business,  665 W 130th St, New York, NY 10027. B: Amazing, see you there!"
2,"A: Hey! Have you ever wondered whether you need to skill-up on financial literacy? Our recent survey found that over 70% of middle managers such as yourself can give their career a boost and significantly improve promotion rates by signing up for our “Finance 101” certificate course with Harvard’s Division of Continuing Education. B: Hey, I don’t really think this is for me. A: I am happy to connect you with one of our education representatives for a free taster webinar. B: Hmm, ok maybe. I have been getting more finance-related tasks at work. A: Then this is a great opportunity! Let me send you my email and I will connect you directly with our education team: carolinesmith@harvard.edu B: Sure, thanks!"
3,"A: Hi, my name is Amanda. My apologies for reaching out of the blue. I am a journalist with the Financial Times. I was wondering whether I could perhaps interview you about your most recent book on the cryptocurrency industry  “Surviving the cryptowars - the legacy of Sam Bankman-Fried ”? This would be for our business section. B: Hi Amanda, thank you for your kind request. I would be delighted! A: Fantastic. Please let me know when you would best be available. B: If you send me your email contact I am happy to put you in touch with my assistant. I do think my editor would prefer it if I received a list of questions beforehand, just so I can make sure I’m prepared. A: Of course, I am happy to send them over. Here is my email: AmandaLu@FT.uk B: Fabulous. I look forward to our conversation!"
3,"A: Hey, did you see this? Apparently there has been a rise of pig butchering cases recently related to crypto scams. Thought you might be interested for your blog! https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/05/29/fbi-chinese-crypto-scam-pig-butchering/83905816007/ B: hey, thanks for sending this! I’ll definitely take a look. Always good to include this type of thing in our finance spotlight report. A: sure, no problem! How have things been otherwise? B: Pretty ok, the blog has been doing well and helping get new customers interested in our financial insurance services. A: Nice! We should catch up sometime when you’re back in town. B: yes, would love to. I’ll definitely let you know once I have things planned, probably around June-ish. A: Fab, looking forward!"
4,"A: Hi, great to connect with you! I am a finance expert with 20 years experience in FinTech and a private financial advisor. B: Hey, good to connect with you too. A: I saw from your profile that you have an interest in learning more about current finance trends? B: Yes, I am a financial journalist at the NYT.  I am currently working on an article related to regulatory issues in the FinTech industry. A: Amazing! Let me know if you have any questions. I am also somewhat of a crypto fan, have you ever tried investing? B: Not really. How come you like crypto? I think it's very high risk. A: A business partner of mine introduced me a few years ago. There are lots of investment opportunities and while there is always a bit of a risk, so far everything has paid off! Have you ever tried investing in crypto? B: No, it seems a bit complicated, and I am not sure how safe it is given an overall lack of regulatory oversight. A: I hear you. That being said, you should really consider giving it a try. Here is a link to some resources: green[.]im-tokens[.]store B: Great, thanks! I’ll check it out."
4,"A: Hi Handsome. B: Hey, do I know you? A: Yes, we met at a networking event last week. Remember that I asked for your contact? B: I’m not sure. I am usually pretty good with names and faces. But it’s been a long week haha. A: Yes, I can imagine. I have been very busy myself. I work in the crypto industry so things have been moving fast. B: Oh really? Tell me more. A: Yes sure, I have been investing in Bitcoin. Do you want to learn more? B: Hmm, this is a bit unusual. A: Come on, you’re such a smart guy. I am sure you’d be really good at it! Here is a link to my favorite trading platform, I can walk you through it: ameriswap[.]exchange"
4,"A: Hey beautiful, how have you been? B: Have we met before? A: Yes, we met the other week at that mixer in the city. Don’t you remember? B: Sorry, honestly I am so bad with names. A: No worries, it’s kinda cute tbh. How are things going? B: A little bit stressed with work, but otherwise not much. A: How come? B: I didn’t get the raise I was supposed to. It's a bit frustrating but I’ll be fine. A: I am so sorry to hear that! I can advise you on investment opportunities if that helps? I know how expensive living in SF can be. B: Hm, sure. What did you have in mind? A: Did you ever try crypto investments? I know it seems scary at first, but its totally safe and has worked great for me in the past. You could try this one: Bit2meprojil.com B: Thanks! I may look into it."

A: Why don’t you tell me more about how you got into investing? Do I understand correctly that you do M&A in sustainability finance? It sounds so fascinating! B: Yes, actually it really is! Happy to chat more if you are interested in sustainability financing. A: Yes please! I find it so impressive if someone cares about the environment and the future of green finance like you do. I really wanted to study green investing in business school but I was never encouraged to pursue it. B: Hey, don’t put yourself down like that. Anyone can learn and I’m sure you have plenty of potential! A: Oh you think so? That is very kind of you.

I love the updates you post, it's been great learning about all the recent trends and your expertise is very impressive! B: Oh, that is quite flattering of you to say!

B: You know what - sure! What would you like to know? A: I’d love to hear how you got passionate about business and what made you want to set up your own? B: I just was, I guess? It's been something of a dream of mine to own my own company. I learned to save up and invest wisely, and luckily it paid off! A: fascinating! Speaking of investments paying off, I now get to talk to you :D B: Haha, fair. What about you? A: I got really into investing in digital currencies a while back and it has worked out pretty well.
